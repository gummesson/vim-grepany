# grepany

`grepany` finds and runs any grepping tool in Vim and shows the results in
a split window.

The plugin finds the tool by going from the fastest to the slowest (according
to benchmarks):

1. [`git-grep`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep)
2. [`pt`](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher)
3. [`ag`](http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/)
4. [`ack`](http://beyondgrep.com/)
5. [`grep`](http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html)
